# Degree of Autonomy

## Level of autonomy

- Manual (interactive): User give instructions, relevant context, ... Anything help AI generate accurate response

- Semi-Automatic: AI have ability to plan, reflect, observe and perform actions to get relevant context, ... Anything help give user expected output.

- Automatic: AI operate completely independently, making complex decisions and improving without any human's support. 

## Application

1. Chat Interface (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT)

2. AI IDE (Windsurf IDE, Cursor,etc.)

3. Application (Copilot Extension, Web App, Mobile App, etc.)

4. Self-developed (Simple script, Framework Langchain, Langgraph, etc.)

## Autonomy Level by Application Type

| **Application Type** | **Manual (Interactive)** | **Semi-Automatic** |  **Automatic** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Chat Interface**(e.g., ChatGPT, Claude Desktop)              | ✅ (⚠️Hard to give context)                    | ✅ (⚠️ Simple regular workflows)   | ❌ Not autonomous                                   |
| **AI IDE**(e.g., Windsurf, Cursor)                             | ✅ (⚠️Low productivity)         | ✅ (Quite good for small and mid-size workflows)           | ✅ Automated coding (⚠️Limited by credit/context)     |
| **Application**(e.g., Copilot Extension, Web/Mobile Apps)      | ❌ Inefficient for manual use            | ✅ (⚠️ Requires user confirmation or supervision) | ✅ (⚠️Task-focused autonomy)            |
| **Self-Developed System**(e.g., Scripts, LangChain, LangGraph) | ❌ Ineffective for pure manual operation | ✅ (⚠️ Automates specific workflows)              | ✅ (⚠️Full automation possible but complex to maintain) |
